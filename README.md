# JamBoard

JamBoard is a lightweight web app designed to help music clubs capture, organize,
and collaborate on musical ideas during jam sessions.

## Motivation
I founded and served as President of EFGH Original Music Club at the University of Florida.
While running jam sessions and open mics, I noticed members often had great ideas
that were hard to capture, revisit, or collaborate on afterward.

I built JamBoard to help the club’s current leadership better organize jam sessions
and preserve musical ideas in a collaborative, low-friction way.

## Features
- Record short audio ideas in-browser
- Set categories (riffs, vocals, drums, etc.)
- Tag ideas (acoustic, chorus, rhythm, etc.)
- Browse and comment on shared clips
- Simple, musician-friendly UI

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js / Express
- Storage: mock as of right now, cloud in the near future

## Status
This is an early prototype and demo intended to explore UX and collaboration workflows 
for music creation.
